## What does it do?
Have you ever noticed how some individuals (not you, of course ðŸ˜‰) come up with personal goals, like New Year's resolutions, only to abandon them shortly after? That often happens due to insufficient definition and poor planning for achieving the goal. To help with that, this app lets you define your personal goals by giving them a name, adding a concise description, setting a timeline, and outlining a plan of action to make sure they are accomplished. You can keep track of your progress by regularly updating each goal with reports.
